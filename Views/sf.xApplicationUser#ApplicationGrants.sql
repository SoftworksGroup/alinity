Comments	
--------
This view is used in constructing user interface components. The view does not provide actual data to the application. It is
used to define the structure for a manually created entity used to manage the many-to-many relationship between:

  sf.ApplicationUser 
  and 
  sf.ApplicationGrant 
  through
  sf.ApplicationUserGrant

The manually created entity used to manage the assignment records is not populated by this view but rather by a stored procedure:
  sf.pApplicationUser#GetApplicationGrants. 

The binding of the manually created entity to this view structure is necessary in order for validations to work correctly 
(otherwise a Complex Type could be used on its own).  The prefix "x" is used on the view name to indicate the view does not 
provide any data. 

Example
-------

  *

  sf.xApplicationUser#ApplicationGrants
