Comments	
--------
This view is called by the UI to populate drop-down lists of active employers for assignment to registrants and other stakeholders.
For organizations to be included they must be active (IsActive = 1) and they must also be associated with at least 1 registrant's
practice hours through a relationship (inner join) to dbo.RegistrantPractice. Note that an organization is considered an employer
if the employer attribute bit is turned on.  Even if the organization has one or more active registrant employment records but
does not have the employer attribute turned on, they are excluded.  This is done so that the view can be used as data source for 
selecting  employers.  If the organization is no longer an employer, but may have historical employment records, it is
excluded.
