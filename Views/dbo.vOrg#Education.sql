Comments
--------
This view is called by the UI to populate drop-down lists of active Educational Institutions for assignment to registrants.
For organizations to be included they must be active (IsActive = 1) and they must also be associated with at least 1 credential
through a relationship (inner join) to dbo.RegistrantCredential.  Note that an organization is considered an educational
institution if the credential attribute bit is turned on.  Even if the organization has one or more active credential records but
does not have the attribute turned on, they are excluded.  This is done so that the view can be used as data source for selecting
educational institutions.  If the organization is no longer an educator, but may have historical credential records, it is
excluded.
