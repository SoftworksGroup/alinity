Comments
--------

The function is called by the entity view to set a calculated bit column "IsDeleteEnabled". The column is typically bound to a
delete button on the UI.  The results of the function determine whether or not deletion should be allowed.  The function tests
one or more of the following factors: 1) whether the table contains a system code column in which case deletion is
not allowed, 2) the security granted to the logged in user, and, 3) the existence of child records.

When a child table is related through a foreign key with cascade delete, and all descendants of that table are also related with
cascade delete constraints, then the child table is not considered blocking and will not appear in the SELECT statement.

Table-specific logic can be added through tagged sections (pre and post check). An extended version of the function is not
supported.  Code implemented within code tags is part of the base product and applies to all client configurations.
