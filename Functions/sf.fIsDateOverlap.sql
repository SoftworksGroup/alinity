Comments	
--------
This function is used to determine if two date terms (defined by "Effective" and "Expiry" date-times)  are active at the same
time. This function is most often used in error checking contexts where terms must not overlap each other.  Note that the 
end of each term may be NULL - indicating there is no known end to the term.  While not typically expected, the function also 
supports the start of the term being null which is treated as the term beginning infinitely in the past for the purpose of the 
comparison.

There are five scenarios where the terms can overlap or duplicate as depicted below:
			                   (x)|----------------------------------------|(y)
			    (x - n)|--------------------------------------------------------------|(y + n)
			    (x - n)|------------------------------------|(y - n)
			                                  (x + n)|--------------------------------|(y + n)
			                                  (x + n)|------|(y - n)
			                  (x2)|----------------------------------------|(y2)
