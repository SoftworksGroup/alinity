Comments
--------
This function supports the GL posting process.  It returns a table with the GL accounts and amounts for posting to the 
dbo.GLTransaction table to reflect the current status of the given dbo.InvoicePayment record.  These records are inserted into 
dbo.GLTransaction table during the posting process carried out by pGLTransaction#PostInvoicePayment. 

The table structure includes many interim columns required for determining the amount to post however only the "GLAccountCode"
and "AmountToPost" columns are actually required as the end product. 

The records are derived by joining the invoice-payment record to its associated invoice (dbo.Invoice), and then to that invoice's
line items (dbo.InvoiceItem).  The invoice items store the GL codes which are set there when the invoice is created. After all
revenue accounts have been processed, an additional record is inserted into the table for each tax type collected (if any).

The amounts to post are based on first identifying a level or sequence for posting to the accounts found on the invoice-line 
items. In this version there are only 2 levels supported:  normal accounts and accounts associated with "late fees".  The 
system determines which level an account is in automatically based on logic (i.e. the account is or is not associated with a late
fee).  Amounts are applied to accounts at the later levels last.  In this version, available payments are applied to the late-fee
last.  The design will support creation of additional levels with those levels being defined by meta data either in the 
practice-register-fee table or the GL Account table. Both of these tables parent the invoice-item record.

Note that there may be more than 1 account at the same posting level.  For example, an invoice may involved a base fee, admin fee
and potentially a late fee.  Both the base fee and admin fee could be assigned sequence 1 while the late fee gets a sequence of 2.
The amount of the payment is first prorated against the 2 accounts at the base level.  For example, if the base fee is $150 and 
the Admin fee is $50, then 75% of the payment is available to apply against that account.  This amount is reduced by postings
already made to the account if previous payments exist.

Determining the amount from the current payment to apply against each account at each level also requires consideration of 
amounts paid previously against the given invoice.  Since the postings follow a sequence the algorithm must determine if accounts
earlier in the sequence have already had their amount full posted before moving onto apply amounts to the next level of the 
sequence.  The limit of the amount to apply is the total of that line item.  

Tax Components
--------------
Tax settings on each line item are considered in the calculation.  As each revenue posting amount is determined the table
tracks which of the 3-possible tax types are applied and calculates the amount of the payment that must be reserved for
paying tax even where the payment is partial.  The tax amount is ALWAYS taken; the design does not allow not-paying a tax amount 
on a partial payment in favor of paying it later.  The tax proportional amount of the payment is always allocated to the 
tax accounts affected. 

When tax amounts exist for one or more invoice items additional records are inserted into the output table for posting to the 
GL.  One additional record is inserted for each of the 3-possible tax types.  The records only insert if the tax amount is > 0.01
Note that if the amount of the payment is so small that the tax amount on it is <0.01, then no tax amount will be stored.

Limitations
-----------
Currently determination of late fees is only supported from Renewal invoices. If late fees are associated with other registration
form types they are ignored.  The logic can be expanded to search for late fees associated with other form types.
