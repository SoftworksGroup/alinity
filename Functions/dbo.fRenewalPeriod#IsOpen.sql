Comments	
--------
This function is used throughout the application to indicate whether the renewal period is currently open.  The function takes 
into consideration time values only and does not look to see whether a renewal form is already in place for the registrant
and/or whether or not the member is on a register that allows renewal. This function is used in more generic scenarios such
as whether payment of renewal invoices is permitted which is determined on time only.  Note that the function does consider
whether or not the member is an early verifier or has been granted a renewal extension.

If the registration year is passed in as NULL, then the NEXT registration year is assumed to be the one for which the renewal
schedule is applied.  Otherwise, the renewal open and closed date-times are looked up for the year provided.

The @RegistrantSID parameter should normally be provided.  The function checks to see if the given registrant is a renewal 
verifier (has an earlier renewal start date) or has been granted a renewal extension (later end date). If no registrant key
is provided the function will based its return value on whether the current time is within the open period only (useful in
some reporting scenarios).

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The function does not check if the registrant already has an open renewal for the given year or whether they are currently
on a register that allows renewal. DO NOT add these criteria to this function since the function is used in contexts such
as determining whether a renewal invoice can still be paid which must not be subject to those additional criteria.
