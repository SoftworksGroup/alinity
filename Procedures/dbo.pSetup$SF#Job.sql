This procedure adds jobs provided with the product.  Jobs cannot be added by end users so the content of the table is fixed. A
UI is provided to allow the job label to be updated but the call syntax and job code (JobSCD) are not modifiable by end users or
configurators. A MERGE statement is used to synchronize the target table with the version defined in the procedure.
