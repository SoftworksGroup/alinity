Comments	
--------
This procedure is called to clean-up payment records where the amount paid has gone out of sync with the total amount of the
payment.  The procedure processes all payment records requiring updates.  The update is applied through the subroutine:
dbo.pPayment#Reapply. Because payment amounts may be changing, the procedure all calls the GL Repost procedure on each affected
payment.

The criteria for selecting payments to process is documented in the code below.

The @DebugLevel parameter can be passed when called from development tools to list the payments to be processed to the console.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The procedure makes the call for payment GL reposting after each #ReApply process succeeds. The GL reposting step could be 
completed more quickly if an XML document of all payments were processed at the end, however, if the process fails the list of 
payments that require GL reposting would be lost.  For this reason, the process should be called directly from SSMS by the 
help desk or launched as back-end process to avoid timing out.
