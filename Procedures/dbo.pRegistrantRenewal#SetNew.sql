Comments	
--------
This procedure is called from the UI to setup a new renewal form along with any sub-forms which are configured as part of the
renewal process. Once the records have been inserted, a data set is returned that enables the UI to navigate through the 
form-set.  A subroutine - dbo.pSubForms#GetStatus - handles insert of sub-form components and return of the record set 
providing statuses for navigation.

The identifier of the registration being renewed must be passed in.  This also identifies the registrant. The practice register 
section (what they are renewing to) must also be identified.  If the section they are being renewed to is the same as the section 
on the base registration, then the procedure automatically OVERWRITES that section to the Default section for that register. This 
is done to support transitions where an individual applies or is transferred into the jurisdiction onto an Out-of-Province or
International section of the register.  When they renew, they are automatically moved to the Default register since the special
requirements and designation involved with the application/transfer no longer apply. (See also Limitations)

The renewal year is set automatically based on adding 1 to the year of the registration being renewed.  Note that if more than 1 
year has passed then a REINSTATEMENT option must be used rather than RENEWAL.

The procedure also handles deletion of any pre-existing form in a WITHDRAWN status. Registration records can only have a single
Renewal record associated with them (UK constraint) so any previous WITHDRAWN form must be removed to avoid duplication.  The
procedure handles both the deletion and insertion in a single transaction so that the entire process succeeds or fails
as a unit.  The fact a WITHDRAWN form existed is recorded as a note in the members profile.

If the registrant already has a renewal that is not WITHDRAWN for the given registration, then an error is raised.

Limitations
-----------
If the configuration requires supporting a scenario where individuals must renew to the same section as their base registration
AND that base registration register section is not the default, then the PracticeRegisterSectionSID value must be set directly
in the renewal form logic.
