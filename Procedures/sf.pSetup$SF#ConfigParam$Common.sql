----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments  
--------
This procedure simplifies management of common configuration parameters across applications. While each application will typically 
include some configuration parameters not used by any other application, there are also many common parameters that all 
applications use.  Many of these are used by the framework itself.  For example: "MaxRowsOnSearch" (applied in search 
procedures), and "ProgramErrorSuffix"/"ConfigErrorSuffix" (error messaging) are used by all applications.

This procedure is named as a sub-routine because it should only be called in that context.  The parent procedure will exist
in the product project (not the framework) and should be named: dbo.pSetup$SF#ConfigParam.  This subroutine should be called 
near the top of the logic to return records into a memory table.  The structure of the memory table must match the structure
shown in this procedure!  The typical syntax used appears below:

		-- call the sproc to insert/update the common configuration values
		-- used by the framework

		insert 
			@setup
		(
			 ConfigParamSCD		
			,ConfigParamName	
			,ParamValue				
			,DefaultParamValue
			,DataType					
			,MaxLength				
			,IsReadOnly				
			,UsageNotes				
		)
		exec sf.pSetup$SF#ConfigParam$Common
			 @SetupUser	= @SetupUser
			,@Language  = @Language
			,@Region    = @Region


After the values are passed into the caller's memory table any overrides required to change default settings can be applied to 
the "DefaultParamValue" column through update statements. If necessary documentation can also be over-written with a product 
specific version, however, that should not generally be required.  

Replacement values
------------------
For some parameters placeholder values are inserted in the value and documentation columns to support replacements made in the 
parent procedure.  For example, references to the help desk and system user include a domain token: 

e.g.  system@{SYSTEMUSER}"								->	system@clientorg.com				default user ID for batch processes
			http://support.{PRODUCT}.com				->	http://support.synoptec.com	product name for help desk reference

Note that the "SystemUser" token is replaced by THIS procedure with the @SetupUser passed in.

If the @Region parameter is passed as "Synoptec" or "Permitsy" (recognized product names), then the {PRODUCT} placeholder is
replaced with @Region value.  The {SYSTEMUSER} token is replaced with the @SetupUser value.  Other tokens must be replaced 
by the caller based on product requirements. All tokens must be replaced via an update statement in the parent procedure to complete 
the configuration.  See code - search for "{" - to check for all replacement tokens.

Consider Language setting
-------------------------
As of this writing the procedure only supports returning configuration values in English.  Be sure to avoid overwriting
translated parameter documentation!
