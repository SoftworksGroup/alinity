Comments	
--------
This procedure is designed to be called from the dbo.pInvoicePayment#Insert and #Update procedures.  It modularizes the logic 
required which is the same in both contexts.

The posting date for applied payments (dbo.InvoicePayment) is the same as the posting date on the parent (dbo.Payment) provided
both are entered at the same time.  While that is normally the case, it is possible for a parent payment to be entered first and
remain "unapplied" (or partially unapplied) for a period of time after which the balance remaining is applied.  In that scenario 
the posting date for the invoice-payment record(s) will be different than for the parent.  The data model provides GL Posting date
columns in both dbo.Payment and dbo.InvoicePaymen to handle that scenario.

This procedure is concerned with determining the GL Posting date for the child (dbo.InvoicePayment) record.  The date used is 
dependent on the type of payment but there are several overriding rules - including support of GL dates entered directly
through the UI and passed in the @GLPostingDate parameter. The key of the parent payment must be provided.  

If the parent payment is not in a paid status (e.g. it is a credit card payment for which no response has been received, or the
payment has been CANCELLED), the procedure returns NULL for the posting date since non-paid statuses do not generate GL 
transactions.

Credit card payments get their posting time from the VerifiedTime column on the parent since there should not be any significant
delay between the payment and its application.  This procedure checks for a condition where the VerifiedTime has been received for 
the credit card transaction but is not set on the dbo.Payment record.  This is an error condition that is not fully diagnosed at
the time of this writing.  This procedure recovers from the error condition by making the update on the dbo.Payment record. The
procedure does not diagnose why the error occurred but does log the fact the update was made for further diagnosis by the help
desk.

Point-of-Sale payments always use the creation date on the parent payment for posting since, like credit card payments, the
time the payment is applied cannot vary from the time the payment is created. 

The remaining logic in the procedure applied to other payment types and is concerned with correcting - without raising an 
error - settings of the @GLPostingDate provided through the UI that would otherwise be invalid (e.g. future dated, back dated
prior to the parent payment etc. - see below).  For other payment types (not credit card, not POS) where no date is provided
from the UI the current date is applied.
