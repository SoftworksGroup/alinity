Comments	
--------
This procedure is called in contexts where a record has an "effective period" defined through a pair of date-time column values.
The columns are normally named "EffectiveTime" and "ExpiryTime".  Where an effective range is being forward dated or back-dated
this procedure will ensure the time components in the parameters are set to start-of-day and end-of-day values (12:00am and
11:59pm).  Where a value passed in is on the current day, however, the current time is used instead.

This logic ensures that where date/time ranges are being defined for the future or past, that full-days are reflected but 
allows multiple time ranges to be set within the current day.  Examples of these scenarios in the Alinity application
include:

1) Registration records set for renewal are future dated - and so take effect at midnight on the first day of the new
registration period and end at the end of the registration year.

2) An applicant may be approved the same day as they apply.  One registration record is created when they apply and
another when they are approved.  They both occur on the same day and do not overlap since current-day time values 
are used.
