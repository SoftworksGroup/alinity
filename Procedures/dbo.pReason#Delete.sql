Procedure : dbo.pReason#Delete
Notice    : Copyright © 2019 Softworks Group Inc.
Summary   : deletes 1 row in the dbo.Reason table

Comments
--------
This procedure is used in maintenance of the dbo.Reason table. The procedure requires a primary key value to locate the record
to delete.

If the @UpdateUser parameter is set to the special value "SystemUser", then the system user established in sf.ConfigParam is
applied.  This option is useful for conversion and system generated deletes the user would not recognized as having caused. Any
other setting of @UpdateUser is ignored and the user identity is used for the deletion.

The @RowStamp parameter should always be passed when calling from the user interface. The @RowStamp parameter is used to
preemptively check for an overwrite.  The value should be passed as the RowStamp value from the row when it was last
retrieved into the UI. If the RowStamp on the record changes from the value passed, this procedure will raise an exception and
avoid the overwrite.  For calls from back-end procedures, the @RowStamp parameter can be left blank and it will default to the
current time stamp on the record (avoiding the need to look up the value prior to calling.)

Other parameters are provided to set context of the deletion event for table-specific and client-specific logic.

Table-specific logic can be added through tagged sections (pre and post update) and a call to an extended procedure supports
client-specific logic. Logic implemented within code tags (table-specific logic) is part of the base product and applies to all client
configurations. Calls to the extended procedure occur immediately after the table-specific logic in both "pre-delete" and "post-delete"
contexts.  A transaction is used to commit/rollback all changes as a logical unit.

Client specific customizations must be implemented in the ext.pReason procedure. The extended procedure is only called
where it exists in the DB. The first parameter passed @Mode is set to either "delete.pre" or "delete.post" to provide context for
the extended logic.

The @zContext parameter is an additional construct available to support overrides where different results are produced based on
content provided in the XML from the client tier. This parameter may contain multiple values.

This procedure is constructed to support the "Change Data Capture" (CDC) feature. Capturing the user making deletions requires
that the UpdateUser column be set before the record is deleted.  If this is not done, it is not possible to see which user
made the deletion in the CDC table. To trap audit information, the "$isDeletedColumn" bit is set to 1 in an update first.  Once
the update is complete the delete operation takes place. Both operations are handled in a single transaction so that both rollback
if either is unsuccessful. This ensures no record remains in the table with the $isDeleteColumn$ bit set to 1 (no soft-deletes).

Business rules for deletion cannot be established in constraints so must be created in this procedure for product-based common rules
and in the ext.pReason procedure for client-specific deletion rules.
