Comments  
--------
This procedure inserts both codes required by the application and a some example records of optional reasons the user can create in
their configuration.  Deleting or updating any previously required system values must be handled in the procedure as well.

Pre-existing records are not deleted or updated by this procedure.

Maintenance Note
----------------
It is generally easier to create new reason records through the user interface.  To extract those reasons into the work table
structure - use the SELECT below:

select
	',(' + (case when r.IsLockedGroup = 1 then '@ON' else '@OFF' end) + ', ' + sf.fQuoteString(r.ReasonCode) + ', ' + sf.fQuoteString(r.ReasonName) + ', '
	+ sf.fQuoteString(isnull(r.ToolTip, r.ReasonName)) + ', ' + '(select rg.ReasonGroupSID from dbo.ReasonGroup rg where rg.ReasonGroupSCD = '''
	+ r.ReasonGroupSCD + '''))'
from
	dbo.vReason r
where
	r.ReasonCode like '%.%'
order by
	r.IsLockedGroup desc
 ,r.ReasonGroupSCD
