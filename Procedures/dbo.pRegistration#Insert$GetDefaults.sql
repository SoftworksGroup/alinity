Comments	
--------
This procedure is called from pRegistration#Insert and pInvoice#SetOnFormChange procedures to return default values for effective 
and expiry times, as well as other related values for the new registration record.  The logic is separated out of the #Insert 
procedure to simplify maintenance and testing due to its complexity.

Note that unless @TerminatePriorRegistration is passed as 0 (OFF), any registration which has an expiry date after the 
new @ExpiryTime, is terminated.  The termination is carried out by updating the dbo.Registration record's ExpiryTime
column.  If only the calculation of an Effective-Time is required by the caller, for example when generating an invoice, then 
the parameter should be passed as 0.  This ensures the prior registration will not terminate until the invoice is paid.

The procedure provides defaults to support common scenarios such as Renewal and reinstatement.  For Renewals the next
Registration Year may be provided which results in the effective and expiry times automatically being set to the years' starting
and ending dates.  Also for Renewals, if the new year registration is generated late because approval from an administrator was
delayed or payment was late, the system will automatically back-date the new registration to the start of the year to avoid
creating a gap.  

For Reinstatements, the procedure automatically expires the previous registration where it was a non-practicing type so that
the reinstated registration applies immediately and no gap or overlap results with the previous in-active registration.

For administrators, temporary permit expiry times default to the number of days specified as the permit length on the
register after the effective date.  Note that even if a temporary permit normally has a period of 90 days, the administrator
may pass an explicit expiry date to shorten or extend the default period. 

This procedure works in parallel with several mandatory (product level) business rules imposed on registration
records which include:

1. Gaps between registrations are not allowed. Ideally the system will maintain a continuous record of the members registration
including one or more periods on the primary in-active register.  This rule may be mitigated to avoid records created 
prior to conversion to Alinity by using the "NoGapStartDate" configuration parameter.  Only registrations created after this
date are included in the no-gap rule.

2. Effective times must not be later than expiry times.  This is a standard data quality rule implemented on all tables
with effective-expiry time column pairs.

3. Overlaps in registrations are not allowed.  A member may only have one active registration at the same time. 

4. Deletion of a future dated registration is allowed if that registration never came into effect and, if no payments are applied 
on its associated invoice.  The administrator can un-apply payments on the associated invoice to get around this restriction. 
The associated invoice is also cancelled in this operation if one exists.
