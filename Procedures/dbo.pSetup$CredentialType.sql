This procedure populates the dbo.CredentialType table with starting values during the application installation process. The
procedure does not modify the table if any records are found in the table. The procedure only inserts the records where the
table is empty.

Records in this table can be added and deleted by end users and the Alinity Service Desk team to meet the requirements of the
client.  The records inserted by the procedure are examples only and may be replaced/modified as required.
