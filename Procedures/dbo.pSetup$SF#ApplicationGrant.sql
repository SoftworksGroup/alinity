Summary  : Updates dbo.ApplicationGrant master table with starting values for the application

Comments
--------
This procedure synchronizes the sf.ApplicationGrant table with the settings required by the current version of the application. 
If a record is missing it is added. Where the record exists, it is set to current values. ApplicationGrants no longer used are
deleted from the table. One MERGE statement is used to carryout all operations.

This procedure has one edge case bug: if a record is removed from this procedure and that record exists in a child record in 
sf.Notification the merge statement will fail on the foreign key constraint. 

Example:
--------

<TestHarness>
	<Test Name="Basic" IsDefault="true" Description="Ensures sproc executes successfully. If no child records exist, previous set 
	up data is deleted prior to test.">
