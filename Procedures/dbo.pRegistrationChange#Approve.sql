Comments	
--------
This procedure is called when the "APPROVE" action is called from the UI (by an administrator). A dynamic form is NOT involved
with the Registration Change process so no calls to sf.pForm#Post are carried out.

The procedure is most often called from pRegistrationChange#Update or a front end batch approval process.  If the calling 
program has not yet changed the status of the record to APPROVED, this procedure sets that status (this supports batch
calling).

The procedure checks to ensure any requirements associated with the registration change have been met.  It is also responsible
for calling the invoice generation process to charge the member where the change requires payment.  If charges do not result, 
a $0 invoice must still be configured in setup.  If no amount is owing for the change, or an amount was owing but could be paid 
off through existing unapplied payments, then new registration record is also created as part of the transaction initiated by 
this procedure.  Generation of the new registration record completes the approval process.

If an amount is owing for the change, the new registration record is not created until the member pays it which is handled 
through the payment action.  

Subroutines are called to handle the various stages of the process.

Note that once a form is in an APPROVED state, it can no longer be edited.  

@ReasonSID
----------
The @ReasonSID parameter is optional and may be passed by the caller to fill-in the ReasonSID on the resulting dbo.Registration
record. The value is normally provided by the @ReasonSIDOnApprove column on the base entity. The value is intended to provide 
explanation as to why the new registration was approved/required if not following a typical process.  For example, it may 
provide the reason why a requirement normally required, was by-passed in the case of this particular registrant.
