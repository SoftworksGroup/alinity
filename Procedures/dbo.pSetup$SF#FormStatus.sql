Comments	
--------
This procedure synchronizes the sf.FormStatus table with the settings required by the current version of the application. 
If a record is missing it is added. Where the record exists, it is set to current values. Form-Statuses no longer used are
deleted from the table. One MERGE statement is used to carryout all operations.
