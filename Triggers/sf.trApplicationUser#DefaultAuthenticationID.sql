Summary : Updates the AuthenticationID column value with the RowGUID where no value was provided

Comments
--------
This trigger ensures that when the AuthenticationSystemID column begins with "[!", that it receives the value of the RowGUID
column.  

The AuthenticationSystemID column receives a GUID, or similar identifier, when a federated login system like MS Account or Google
Account is used. This identifies the user in a more permanent way since it is possible for the email captured in the UserName 
column to change over time.  The value can be passed in to sf.pApplicationUser#Authorize during the startup process to find
the user account instead of using the email address stored in the UserName.  Where no federated provider is used (direct email 
login) the AuthenticationSystemID column is set to the same value as the RowGUID (by this trigger).

Note - no test harness has been added to this trigger intentionally as it is tested automatically by the setup process.
